					Service.</b><br/><br/>
					What information do we collect?
					<br/><br/>
					We collect information when you create an account or use the Platform. We also collect information you
					share with us from third-party social network providers, and technical and behavioral information about
					your use of the Platform. We also collect information contained in the messages you send through our
					Platform and, if you grant us access, information from your phone book on your mobile device. More
					information about the categories and sources of information is provided below.
					<br/>
					Information you choose to provide
					For certain activities, such as when you register, upload content to the Platform, or contact us directly,
					you may provide some or all of the following information:<br/><br/>
					• Registration information, such as age, username and password, language, and email or phone
					number<br/>
					• Profile information, such as name, social media account information, and profile image<br/>
					• User-generated content, including comments, photographs, livestreams, audio recordings,
					videos, and virtual item videos that you choose to create with or upload to the Platform (“User
					Content”). We collect User Content through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload,
					regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that User Content, in order to recommend
					audio options and provide other personalized recommendations. If you apply an effect to your
					User Content, we may collect a version of your User Content that does not include the effect.<br/>
					• Content, including text, images, and video, found in your device's clipboard, with your permission.
					For example, if you choose to initiate content sharing with a third-party platform, or choose to
					paste content from the clipboard into the BuzzTender App, we access this information stored in
					your clipboard in order to fulfill your request.<br/>
					• Payment information, including payment card numbers or other third-party payment information
					(such as PayPal) where required for the purpose of payment<br/>
					• Your phone and social network contacts, with your permission. If you choose to find other users
					through your phone contacts, we will access and collect the names and phone numbers and
					match that information against existing users of the Platform. If you choose to find other users
					through your social network contacts, we will collect your public profile information as well as
					names and profiles of your social network contacts<br/>
					• Your opt-in choices and communication preferences<br/>
					• Information to verify an account such as proof of identity or age <br/>
					• Information in correspondence you send to us<br/>
					• Information you share through surveys or your participation in challenges, sweepstakes, or
					contests such as your gender, age, likeness, and preferences.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Information we obtain from other sources</b><br/>
					We may receive the information described in this Privacy Policy from other sources, such as:
					Social Media and Login Services. If you choose to link or sign up using  a third-party social network or
					login service (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Google), we may collect information from these
					services, including your contact lists for these services and information relating to your use of the Platform
					in relation to these services. If you link your BuzzTender account to another service, we may receive
					information about your use of that service.<br/>
					Third-Party Services. We may collect information about you from third-party services, such as
					advertising partners, data providers, and analytics providers.<br/>
					Other Users of the Platform. Sometimes other users of the Platform may provide us information about
					you, including through customer service inquiries.<br/>
					Other Sources. We may collect information about you from other publicly available sources.
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Information we collect automatically</b>
					<br/><br/>
					We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Platform, including internet or
					other network activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related data (as described below),
					unique device identifiers, browsing and search history (including content you have viewed in the
					Platform), and Cookies (as defined below).<br/><br/>
					<b>Usage Information</b><br/><br/>
					We collect information regarding your use of the Platform and any other User Content that you generate
					through or upload to our Platform. <br/><br/>
					<b>Device Information</b><br/><br/>
					We collect certain information about the device you use to access the Platform, such as your IP address,
					user agent, mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifiers for advertising purposes, model of your device,
					the device system, network type, device IDs, your screen resolution and operating system, app and file
					names and types, keystroke patterns or rhythms,  battery state, audio settings and connected audio
					devices. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we will be able to use your profile information to identify
					your activity across devices. We may also associate you with information collected from devices other
					than those you use to log-in to the Platform. <br/><br/>
					<b>Location data</b><br/><br/>
					We collect information about your approximate location, including location information based on your SIM
					card and/or IP address. With your permission, we may also collect precise location data (such as GPS).<br/><br/>
					<b>Image and Audio Information</b><br/><br/>
					We may collect information about the images and audio that are a part of your User Content, such as
					identifying the objects and scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of face and
					body features and attributes, the nature of the audio, and the text of the words spoken in your User
					Content. We may collect this information to enable special video effects, for content moderation, for
					demographic classification, for content and ad recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying
					operations. We may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information as defined under US laws, such
					as faceprints and voiceprints, from your User Content. Where required by law, we will seek any required
					permissions from you prior to any such collection.<br/><br/>
					<b>Messages</b>
					<br/><br/>
					We collect and process, which includes scanning and analyzing, information you provide when you
					compose, send, or receive  messages through the Platform’s messaging functionality. That information
					includes the content of the message and information about when the message has been sent, received
					and/or read, as well as the participants of the communication. Please be aware that messages sent to
					other users of the Platform will be accessible by those users and that we are not responsible for the
					manner in which those users use or disclose messages.<br/><br/>
					<b>Metadata</b><br/><br/>
					When you upload or create User Content, you automatically upload certain metadata that is connected to
					the User Content. Metadata describes other data and provides information about your User Content that
					will not always be evident to the viewer. In connection with your User Content the metadata can describe
					how, when, where, and by whom the piece of User Content was created, collected, or modified and how
					that content is formatted. It also includes information, such as your account name, that enables other
					users to trace back the User Content to your user account. Additionally, metadata includes data that you
					choose to provide with your User Content, e.g. any hashtags used to mark keywords to the video and
					captions.<br/><br/>
					<b>Cookies</b><br/><br/>
