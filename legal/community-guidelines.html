					<b><p>Introduction</p></b>
<p><i>Last updated, November 2022</i></p>
<p>BuzzTender's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world.</p>
<p>We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our CommunityGuidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.</p>
<p>At BuzzTender, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly. 
</p><p>We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on BuzzTender.</p>
<p>Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on BuzzTender. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us.</p>
<p>We will remove any content including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that</p>
<p>are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other</p>
<p>platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of</p>
<p>real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement</p>
<p>authorities. The full BuzzTender experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts</p>
<p>of people we suspect are under this age. (In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in BuzzTender</p>
<p>for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional</p>
<p>safeguards and privacy protections.)</p>
<p>Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce</p>
<p>discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in</p>
<p>the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.</p>
<p>At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited</p>
<p>circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in</p>
<p>fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression</p>
<p>on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may</p>
<p>first include safety measures such as an &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; screen or warning.</p>
<p>In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to</p>
<p>evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping BuzzTender a safe</p>
<p>place for creativity and joy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Minor safety</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. BuzzTender defines a minor</p>
<p>as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment,</p>
<p>or exploitation of minors on BuzzTender. Any content, including animation or digitally created or</p>
<p>manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our</p>
<p>platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and</p>
<p>supporting evidence &nbsp;to the National Center for Missing &amp;amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any</p>
<p>additional relevant legal authorities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use BuzzTender, as stipulated in our Terms of</p>
<p>Service. When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the</p>
<p>safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age</p>
<p>of 16 cannot use direct messaging or host a livestream and their content is not eligible to appear in the</p>
<p>For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions). Account holders who are under the</p>
<p>age of 18 cannot send or receive gifts via our virtual gifting features.</p>
<p>Sexual exploitation of minors</p>
<p>BuzzTender will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor.</p>
<p>Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes,</p>
<p>including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is</p>
<p>defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by</p>
<p>predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.</p>

<p>not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide, self-</p>
<p>harm, or disordered eating. However, we do support members of our community sharing their personal</p>
<p>experiences with these issues in a safe way to raise awareness and find community support. We also</p>
<p>encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is</p>
<p>seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a suicide</p>

<p>content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or</p>

<p>Platform security</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A top priority for BuzzTender is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors,</p>
<p>and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary</p>
<p>information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the BuzzTender platform --</p>
<p>which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through</p>
<p>unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt</p>
<p>to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly</p>
<p>prohibited.</p>
<p>Do not:</p>
<p> Attempt to access the BuzzTender platform in an unauthorized manner, and do not create fake or</p>
<p>misleading versions of the BuzzTender platform</p>
<p> Create or distribute malicious files, content, or messages that contain viruses, Trojan horses,</p>
<p>worms, logic bombs, or other materials that may be harmful to the community or platform</p>
<p> Use automated scripts, web crawling, software, deceptive techniques, or any other way to</p>
<p>attempt to obtain, acquire, or request login credentials or other sensitive information, including</p>
<p>non-public data, from BuzzTender or its users</p>
<p> Leverage BuzzTender accounts under false or fraudulent pretenses to distribute spam, phishing,</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Ineligible for the For You feed</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring</p>
<p>creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder&rsquo;s FYF</p>
<p>is based on a personalized recommendation system. Our recommendation system is designed with user</p>
<p>safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation.</p>
<p>While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes BuzzTender unique, the FYF is intended for a general</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth</p>
<p>of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform.</p>
<p>Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform,</p>
<p>searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.</p>
<p>Minor safety</p>
<p>Minors&rsquo; sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for</p>
<p>identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not</p>
<p>eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion</p>
<p>of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -</p>
<p>- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective</p>
<p>cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Dangerous stunts and sports</p>
<p>Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead</p>
<p>to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-</p>
<p>professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges</p>
<p>performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).</p>
<p>Overtly sexualized content</p>
<p>We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or</p>
<p>may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate</p>
<p>experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This</p>
<p>would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual</p>
<p>(e.g., strip teases).</p>
<p>Tobacco and alcohol products</p>
<p>BuzzTender is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting,</p>
<p>mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a</p>
<p>dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco</p>
<p>products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please</p>
<p>remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of</p>
<p>alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our</p>
<p>Community Guidelines as well.</p>
<p>Violent and graphic content</p>
<p>Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn&amp;#39;t everyone&amp;#39;s preference. Content that can cause</p>
<p>discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares,</p>
<p>makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and</p>
<p>graphic content is not allowed on BuzzTender; however, in certain situations we may not remove some</p>
<p>types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events</p>
<p>are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn&amp;#39;t appropriate for all audiences,</p>
<p>it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; screen or warning.</p>
<p>Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content</p>
<p>We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates</p>
<p>users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the</p>
<p>platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or</p>
<p>share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a</p>
<p>group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful</p>
<p>content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for</p>
<p>recommendation.</p>
<p>Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content</p>
<p>Original and entertaining content form the core of the BuzzTender community. To maintain the positive</p>
<p>experience our users expect from the BuzzTender platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible</p>
<p>for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from BuzzTender,</p>
<p>other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added</p>
<p>new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed</p>
<p>logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos.</p>
<p>Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful</p>
<p>websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-</p>
<p>commerce).</p>
